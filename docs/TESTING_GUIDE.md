## üöÄ Render Deployment Testing

### After Deploying Backend to Render:

1. **Test Health Endpoint**
   - Visit: https://snuggleup-backend.onrender.com/health
   - Expected: `{"status":"ok","database":"connected"}`

2. **Test Registration via Frontend**
   - Update frontend to use: https://snuggleup-backend.onrender.com
   - Register a new account
   - Verify token is saved in localStorage

3. **Test Order Creation**
   - Complete full checkout flow
   - Check Render logs for "Order created" message
   - Verify order appears in Order History

4. **Test PayFast Webhook**
   - Complete payment in PayFast sandbox
   - Check Render logs for "Order marked as completed"
   - Refresh Order History ‚Üí status should be "completed"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot find module 'better-sqlite3'"
**Solution**: Run `npm install` in backend folder

### Issue: "JWT secret not defined"
**Solution**: Add `JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key` to .env or Render environment variables

### Issue: "Database locked"
**Solution**: Ensure only one server instance is running

### Issue: "Invalid token" error
**Solution**: Token may have expired (7 days). Login again to get new token.

### Issue: Orders not appearing in history
**Solution**: 
- Check that payment was completed successfully
- Check Render logs for database errors
- Verify order was created (check logs for order number)

### Issue: User stays logged out after refresh
**Solution**: Check browser localStorage for "token" and "user" keys
